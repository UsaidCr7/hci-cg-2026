                Explain the difference between a semantic element (e.g., nav)
                and a generic element (e.g., div).
              </strong>
            </p>
           <p>
  Semantic HTML elements are used when the role of content needs to be
  clearly communicated. For example, the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element
  indicates that the enclosed links are part of the site’s navigation.
  This aligns with the principles discussed by Dix et al., where clear
  structure helps users understand and move through an interface more
  easily.
</p>

<p>
  Generic elements such as <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> do not describe the
  purpose of their content and act only as neutral containers. While
  they are useful for grouping elements, relying on them instead of
  semantic elements can make an interface harder to interpret for both
  users and assistive technologies.

              <strong>
                Why does KLM not model high-level planning and interpretation?
              </strong>
            </p>
           <p>
  The Keystroke-Level Model focuses on estimating the time required to
  perform routine tasks by experienced users. For this reason, it does
  not account for high-level planning or interpretation, as these are
  assumed to have already been completed before task execution begins.
  The model concentrates only on observable, low-level actions rather
  than cognitive decision-making.
